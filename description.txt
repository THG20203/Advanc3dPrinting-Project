The repository utilizes a combination of TypeScript, React, CSS, and HTML, each serving a distinct purpose to enhance web development. TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript, offers strong typing and compile-time error checking, making the codebase more robust and maintainable. React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, is employed to create reusable UI components, thereby improving the efficiency of development. CSS is used for styling these components, allowing for a visually appealing and consistent design across the application. HTML acts as the backbone, structuring the web content and integrating seamlessly with React to render the user interface. Together, these technologies provide a comprehensive framework for developing dynamic and responsive web applications.
